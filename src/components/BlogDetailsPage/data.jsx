    "Buying bamboo straws from real bamboo stalks that you can reuse over and over again is about as sustainable and planet-friendly as you can get. If we compare the damage that single-use plastics are causing to our coastlines with what happens when bamboo has reached the end of itsâ€™ life, there really is no question on which material has the harshest effects on our environment. The good news is that once you have finished with your bamboo straw completely, you can simply toss them onto the compost heap where they will break down and compose naturally.",

  header2: "How are bamboo straws made?",
  descp2:
    "Vietnamese farmers will first travel into the bamboo plantations and forests to seek out the bamboo trees which are at full maturity. It is important that the trees picked are of good quality. Once identified and discovered, the stalks are then chopped off and transported back to the farm where they will be allowed to dry naturally under the sunlight.The bamboo stems are then cut from their natural state into lengths suitable for straws. We are a zero waste bamboo straw company, which means that we use all parts of the stalk and the material. This is why bamboo straws differ in thickness; their unique charm being that each straw is completely different! Once the stems have been cut, they then gets sanded, filed and etched to give them a smooth and natural finish.",
