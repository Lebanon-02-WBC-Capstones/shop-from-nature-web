I also have vivid nightmares of kids at my school passing the roll-on around the boys changing room, classmates would one after the other rub it in their hairy pits. Surely this can’t be the hygienic solution can it? As consumers we are easily led to believe one thing by powerful marketing that just isn’t true. If 100 women chase a man around an island on the TV because he is wearing Lynx Africa it must be incredible mustn’t it? But the reality is far from it. Lynx and other deodorants smell okay. They work well enough too. But research from the journal of science in early 2018 has shown that petroleum-based chemicals used in perfumes, paints and other consumer products can, taken together, emit as much air pollution in the form of volatile organic compounds, or V.O.C.s, as motor vehicles do. Not only that, the packaging from these products is less than often recycled and usually ends up in landfills or oceans.":"Across the pond they use roll-ons mostly.

    "My biggest tip…. Travel water purifiers. The one I carry with me is by a company called ‘LifeStraw’ It is extremely portable and it literally allows you to drink from a pond (if you wanted to!). I do a lot of trekking, so it’s the perfect companion for me. There are many variants available, so if you are going to be in a country where you know tap water is potentially ‘diarrhoea threatening’, buy a water purifier in the form of a bottle! They are compact, travel friendly and don’t cost a lot. If you consider that you’ll otherwise be spending at least £1 a day on water from local stores and wasting tons of plastic bottles in the meantime, then buying one goes a long way in reducing your single-use plastic consumption.":"My biggest tip….
